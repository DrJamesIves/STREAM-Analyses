% This function takes in a subfolder within participant easy_files, it then searches the folders for .easy enobio files. It makes sure that the files
% are at least a megabyte and then loads them into an EEGLAB format and saves them as .mat files. This has the advantage of making the files a lot
% smaller without losing any data and also makes them quicker and easier to read into matlab. Also saves a quick output of what was converted in the
% root folder.

%% Load and convert easy to eeglab

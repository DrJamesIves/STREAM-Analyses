% The purpose of this function is to merge trials together that have been epoched. This is different to the continuous trials, here there are defined
% onset and offset markers but these trials are spread throughout the task list.

% This function expects ds from ds = getSettings(), which is mainly for paths, a cell array of names that should be found exactly within the file
% names, an input folder to focus on and a boolean value on whether to delete the constituent part files.

% Called only if running this separately
